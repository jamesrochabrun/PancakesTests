//MARK integration tests holds asynchronous calls or networking code
//MARK: testing asynchronous calls using mocks
//tests can end before the completion hanlder is called
//thats why we use expectations
//we provide a time interval
//we might not rely the test in networking
//thats why we use mock objects , stub
//becuase the lack of dynamic type support in swift is a bit more complicated to write mocks than objective c
//we can create mocks by:
//subclassing and overriding an existing object
//or conforming to a protocol


//INTEGRATION TESTS, involves interaction between systems and components such as networking
